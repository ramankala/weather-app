<h1> Weather App </h1>

<h2>Brief Introduction </h2>

A weather app that uses the weather API from openweathermap.org and displays information about the weather from a city of choosing.  Users can enter any city they wish, and they can choose to receive temperatures in Celsius or Farenheit.

<h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>

This project demonstrated by abilities in receiving data from open source APIs and manipulating that data using Async/Await.  I was able to further develop my skills in handling Promises, as well as getting an in depth look at asynchronous JavaScript, event loops, and its uses in fetching data from APIs.

<h2>Challenges I Faced</h2>

A challenge I faced on this project was trying to process the Promise object that I fetched from an open source API.  I resolved the issue by processing the response a second time using the .json() method.  This returned a promise that I was able to work with and filter in order to obtain the data I needed.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
