<h1> Weather App </h1>

<h2>Brief Introduction </h2>

A weather app that uses the weather API from openweathermap.org and displays information about the weather from a city of choosing.  Users can enter any city they wish, and they can choose to receive temperatures in Celsius or Farenheit.

<h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>

This project demonstrated by abilities in receiving data from open source APIs and manipulating that data using Async/Await.  I was able to further develop my skills in handling Promises, as well as getting an in depth look at asynchronous JavaScript, event loops, and its uses in fetching data from APIs.

<h2>Challenges I Faced</h2>

A challenge I faced on this project was trying to process the Promise object that I fetched from an open source API.  I resolved the issue by processing the response a second time using the .json() method.  This returned a promise that I was able to work with and filter in order to obtain the data I needed.

<h2>Live Demo</h2>

In order to use the app, enter any city in the search bar and select an option of celsius or farenheit to view the temperature in the desired metric.  Clicking the submit button will retrieve the desire weather data for the user.
